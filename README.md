# Using Phat Contract as VRF Provider

This repository contains code examples demonstrating the usage of the VRF provided by [Phat Contract](https://phala.network/phat-contract).

- native_phat_contract: the simple implementaion shown how to call vrf in rust.
- hardhat_solidity: The Phat Contract powered Oracle provides VRF capacity to any EVM chains and Solidity Smart Contracts in this ERC-721 NFT demo.
- foundry_solidity: Same to the hardhat implementaion but use foundry instead hardhat here.

## NOTE

Both hardhat and foundry examples here using npm for dependencies management, run `npm install` or `yarn install` before compiling.
